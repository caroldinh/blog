He always seemed inflammable: Atlan the flamethrower, nobody’s brother. Everyone knew him by his name. Everyone but me believed that he could never burn.  

I'd known him most deeply, more so than either of our parents, but I was still wrong in the end. When the campus police fished him from the burning van, he looked like an angel. His clothes hung in charred scraps off his body but his skin stayed as clean as fresh firewood. Gold as a phoenix's feather. We couldn't restore him to ash so we put him in the ground. My Buddhist mother hated it. Though agnostic, Atlan would have hated it too.  

The coroner said that Atlan had suffocated; they’d cut his lungs to find them full of ash and smoke. I couldn’t stamp out that image from my mind. Atlan the flamethrower, Atlan the inflammable, choking on the products of his gift. A chest made for laughter gasping instead for its final breaths. When we sealed the lid shut, closing him off from oxygen forever, I stopped breathing as if I were him. It was only when my lungs ached for nourishment that I remembered who it was inside the coffin.  

At the funeral, his roommate Ewan came up to me to talk. I’d never met him but Atlan told me about his buddies sometimes. He was one of the only white guys present and he seemed relieved to see me, realize that this Viet boy seemed just as lost as he was. “You’re Atlan’s brother, right?” It was not a question for me but rather a reassurance to himself that someone’s grief was greater than his own. His flat-toned English sounded almost comic against my family’s tongue. "Man. He was laughing when I saw him last. He was laughing when I saw him *first*, for that matter. He was always laughing. He laughed so much.”  

Ewan rambled on as if telling me something I didn’t know. I stopped paying attention after he described the party: Solo cups and whooping boys and the smell of sweat and gasoline, cars lined outside the dorm. It was everything the movies said they’d be. Hearing the whole story made me dread college even more: Atlan always said he’d help me through the shithole called college admissions when it came time. That was supposed to be next year.  

My mind wandered and today became Tuesday became twelve years ago. “I want you to turn around and watch the shadows,” said my brother, the flamethrower, come to life for me once more. I was four at the time and full of laughs. I laughed when he grabbed my shoulders and rotated me until I faced the patterns dancing across the brick wall. We were in our backyard where we’d always played with fire underneath the clear sky.  

“What are you doing?” I was still laughing. I thought it was some sort of prank, of course—growing up with brothers, everything was a prank—which Atlan neither confirmed nor denied.   

“I’m going to show you something,” my brother said, “that’s all.” On the wall, his shadow lifted a nimble hand.  

I counted to five and nothing happened, so I turned around. There he was, Atlan the flamethrower, fire cupped in his palm as the golden light curled around his grin. “Look at that,” he said, beaming. With his other hand, he pointed back towards the wall. “Look. Did you know that fire has no shadow?”   

He would bring up that fun fact for years. Even after he stopped, I never forgot—never forgot to scour for a shadow every time I saw a lick of flame. I checked birthday candles, barbeques, firecrackers. At restaurants I peeked inside oil lamps searching for a blip in the light.  

Even at the funeral, when Ewan planted the video before my eyes, I watched as my brother set our father’s van on fire with his palm. I watched him get inside, laughing; watched him strap on his seatbelts and drive at maximum speed, braking too late upon reaching the barrier beside the road. The van, still an engine-powered meteor, flipped over the hill and disappeared from the screen; the video ended and I imagined my brother pinned beneath melting airbags, glass windows smashed, car caving in. I saw no shadow.  

I didn’t blink for the entire video until Ewan's phone extinguished, but I flinched as the screen went black. My cheeks were wet; my eyes burned dry after keeping them open so long.  

That day I filled my hands with blaze. Lit matches by my brother’s altar; dipped the incense sticks in flame. As I blew out their tips, I avoided Atlan’s portrait, his glossy grin, like I was lying to him about something. The photograph originally captured both of us—at the corner of the page, Atlan’s arm reached out towards nobody and I extrapolated in my head where my shoulder would have been, had the photo not been cropped around the dead boy.  

By night I reeked of incense: raw and burning. Beside me in the back seat, my mother held my hand for the drive home. She kissed my hair, undid the white headband and folded it neatly beside hers. There was no laughter in the shotgun seat, no shadow. No boy to make a shadow of, only the smile of the half-moon.  

When we got home, I went to the backyard where Atlan always showed me his tricks. In my pocket was a matchbox: I lit one, and then two more, throwing them onto the sidewalk like a bonfire. I lit another three, the spark addictive. Each stick erupted at its sizzling tip like Atlan’s skin: golden-brown and capable. The wood cackled and cackled. The matches curled and blackened as they entered the bonfire, the way I’d always feared his fingers would burn.  

My brother, ever the flamethrower, would have been proud. Proud of the light, of course, not of the lighter; he would have thrown his palm into the flames and grabbed gulps of it like fistfuls of gold. *Look,* he would have told me, *look* what I can do, as if he were showing me for the first time; as if he were showing *himself.* His eyes would erupt in genuine wonder. I never knew him to grow bored.  

Batting Atlan’s ghost from my gaze, I turned and sat down.  

The firelight hugged me from behind, heat curling its arms around my ribs and my shoulders. Tight as a flamethrower’s embrace, as wildfire personified. But when I turned to the brick wall, I just saw the silhouette of a boy, cross-legged, knees jutting upward like the crumbling wood behind him. I searched my shadow for a brother and found nobody there.
