I suppose I ought to write a first post, considering that my ""previous"" two are just copypastes of random fandom rambles I'd at some point saved on the private Discord server where I drop resources, files, and ramblings for future reference. I've preserved the dates of the posts as the date I'd pasted my ramble into my Discord server just so that I have a reference of when I was thinking about those things but I only officially deployed this site today.   

(And *boy* oh boy did mobile responsivity give me a pain in the neck!)  

I'm looking forward to spamming this more in the future. Fortunately there's no subscription option, so the poor fool who decides that my babbling is worth browing through won't be bombarded with notifications after months of radio silence (because that's how blogs always go, for me).  

So, here we are? Take number 249509 at attempting to maintain a blog, because I've quite literally been creating and deleting personal blogs from the Internet since 2014.  

Hello world!
