excerpt: I was the worst version of myself in freshman/sophomore year of high school, when I was stuck in that mindset that my INTP-ness was inherent, and not something I could change. I refused to better myself under the guise of embracing the flaws outlined on the 16Personalities website. I amplified them by taking the tests over and over; selecting answers that leaned more strongly towards where I knew they would lead me and eventually letting those answers infect my real life.

I recently re-took the 16Personalities MBTI test, for no reason other than fun and curiosity. It's something I've done every once in a while, when I grow bored and stumble across my old obsession once again.   

When I was fourteen, a jaded Tumblr INTP, I used the insensitivity as listed on my type's 16Personalities page to justify my assholery. I prided myself on how far I fluctuated into the "T" category—went from around 60% thinking to 80% thinking and I thought I was so much a better person for it. I got INFP today.   

I suppose I should have seen it coming; every time I retook the test beyond freshman year, the needle would move ever so slightly towards the center of the T-F spectrum until today, I crossed the line by 1%. Below are my results, for the record.

Actually, most of the categories inched towards the middle with the exception of introversion/extroversion, which I believe remains in about the same place. Not exactly a surprise. Am I disappointed with my demotion from Logician status? If I were fourteen again, I'd be outraged. But honestly I'm quite satisfied. My goal has, really, been to balance myself and in the thinking/feeling category, I've done just that.  

When I was fourteen and scouring the 16Personalities forums, I stumbled across a post that once said that the "ideal" type really doesn't exist; it would be, rather, someone in the center, a balance of all the types. I suppose that post has stuck with me for longer than I thought it would—it's the only post I remember from my time on those forums other than the rampant homophobia middle-aged analysts loved to infect the threads with, if only for the sake of debate. But anyways, that's what I'm striving for, I suppose. Balance.   

I think a lot of people use the MBTI system to better understand themselves; to delve deeper into learning about their own type. But personally I feel like striving towards being something you are not has done more to better me than labeling myself ever could. And by that I don't mean lying, or putting on a disguise—I mean recognizing what you could do better and reaching towards that.   

I was the worst version of myself in freshman/sophomore year of high school, when I was stuck in that mindset that my INTP-ness was inherent, and not something I could change. I refused to better myself under the guise of embracing the flaws outlined on the 16Personalities website. I amplified them by taking the tests over and over; selecting answers that leaned more strongly towards where I knew they would lead me and eventually letting those answers infect my real life.  

Needless to say, I've grown up quite a bit since then. Probably the thing that really pitched me to the F side was realizing—I would much, much rather help someone else achieve something than achieve it myself. I would rather stay up late helping a peer with their homework than spend the time completing mine, even if I would lose the points for it the next day. I would rather pass on an opportunity given to me to someone who I believed would need it or deserve it more than I did. This mindset certainly doesn't come without its flaws or its downsides—perhaps it is a side effect of my raging impostor syndrome—but the urge to make yourself helpful or useful to someone else isn't exactly the worst coping mechanism, is it? And it worked. It has helped me through a lot.  

Anyways. I don't particularly care about whether or not I'm an F or a T (or maybe I do? Who knows why I decided to write a whole blog post about it)—I'm not as attached to MBTI as I used to be, but I'm curious about what I'll get the next time I'll take the test.
