After the disastrous premiere of his First Symphony, Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff had fallen into depression, even resorting to hypnotic therapy in an attempt to “cure” his creative block. I’d love to watch Rachmaninoff’s brilliance unmask itself after four years of silence during the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto.  

Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano Concerto means so much to me personally, not only as a music enthusiast and former pianist but also as a storyteller and an artist. The piece itself is stunning—vivid as being on deck in the midst of a storm at sea. The twinkling treble sparkles and dances, at some times, like stars; at other times, it strikes like staggering lightning. But behind the piece is the story of a young composer with big dreams.  

Rachmaninoff was 24 when his Symphony No. 1 in D Minor premiered. If you streamed the piece today, you’ll find it brimming with majestic intensity—but the symphony’s first audience did not experience it as such. The conductor, Alexander Glazunov, made unwarranted modifications to the score and botched a rushed rehearsal before arriving at the podium allegedly drunk on opening night. The young Rachmaninoff reportedly fled to the stairs behind the concert hall, unable to bear the disaster on stage. He could only watch in horror as his masterpiece crashed and burned.  

Flaming reviews from the critics he idolized forced Rachmaninoff into depression and creator’s block. During this time, he was unable to compose and taught piano lessons for a living; it was only after his family recommended the services of hypnotherapist Nikolai Dahl that he regained his motivation to write music.  

In 1901, Rachmaninoff premiered his next great work: the Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor. The composer himself performed the piano solo with his cousin conducting. This composition was greeted with the praise it truly deserves, winning Rachmaninoff an award of 500 roubles and paving the route to Rachmaninoff’s recovery from depression.  

Listen to the opening bars of the Concerto’s second movement. Pay attention to the piano—you will find yourself enraptured by a sequence of broken chords, simultaneously aching and optimistic in E major. Like green light reflecting from a lighthouse as you head out to sea. About ten years earlier, Rachmaninoff used this same sequence—originally in A major—to open a trio he wrote for his cousins, the Scanlon sisters. He then recycled this section of the duet for his Concerto.  

I played this same trio with my own sisters several years ago, and learned this opening. The coincidence is poetic—as a piece written originally for three sisters, this trio allowed us to recreate history in our own living room. With six hands on the keyboard, three backsides on the bench, trios had bonded my sisters and I during the time we played piano together. Hearing the Concerto’s second movement to this tedious yet tender trial.  

As a young artist, Rachmaninoff’s journey from his First Symphony to his Second Concerto deeply resonates with me. His creator’s block mirrors my constant struggle with impostor syndrome, creative stagnation, longing, and disappointment when my artistic endeavors don’t go as planned. His recovery fills me with hope and determination.   

I like to joke that Rachmaninoff has become my muse. I could compile an anthology of pieces I’ve created that were directly inspired by Rachmaninoff’s life and work, from the Great Depression historical fiction about a young musician’s depression to a short horror story based on the Prelude in C# Minor to the acrylic painting of a soloist with the sea coming out of his grand piano. Right now, I’m still revising a poem about the Scanlon sisters and revisiting, out of nostalgia, the Rachmaninoff repertoire I’ve learned in the past. Rachmaninoff’s influence on my creative journey will continue for as long as I love music, and for that reason it would be a tremendous honor to experience the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto.
