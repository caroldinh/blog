excerpt: I came into the movie with Ragnarok-level expectations. Same director, right? It didn’t seem like much of a long shot. But compared to Ragnarok, Love and Thunder was incredibly linear and surface-level. The romance subplot fell back into place too easily. Plot twists were predictable. Side characters weren’t even characters, they were cameos. Gorr’s victims were saved through a deus-ex-machina Thor power that was never foreshadowed before. 6.5/10. (CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOR 1-3 AND INFINITY WAR)

I thought it was okay.

What was good: Guns N' Roses action sequences. Valkyrie for the scenes she was in. Our Voldemort-esque Gorr had some good dramatic lines. Jane and Valkyrie's new friendship. This film continued the trend of the MCU’s dipping into horror. The opening scene was pretty good—balance of tragedy, humor, and truth. Felt like an echo Thor: Ragnarok.

And then the first half hour of so felt like nothing.

Vibrant explosions. Space fights. Screaming goats. Smashing buildings. Shirtless fanservice. Bickering Guardians. Homoerotic banter with Chris Pratt. It’s very… ha-ha. In a completely unremarkable way. Now, I was laughing in the theater don’t get me wrong. But I went to the bathroom about a half-hour in (too much iced tea at lunch) and even then didn’t feel like I’d be missing much. We had the bad guy Gorr running around a bit, talking about how you should never meet your heroes and all gods do is wait for your worship and fail you. Heimdall has a son now who idolizes Axl Rose and Thor. Oh, and Jane’s back. Great. I don’t watch Marvel movies for high poetry but the deepest metaphor was that Mjolnir, now commanded by Natalie Portman, was likened to an ex.

I came into the movie with Ragnarok-level expectations. Same director, right? It didn’t seem like much of a long shot. But compared to Ragnarok—which alongside the superhero storyline confronted Asgardian imperialism, re-examined Thor’s family dynamics, and even gave arcs to supporting characters like Valkyrie, Loki, and Skurge—Love and Thunder was incredibly linear and surface-level. The romance subplot fell back into place too easily. Plot twists were predictable. Side characters weren’t even characters, they were cameos. Gorr’s victims were saved through a deus-ex-machina Thor power that was never foreshadowed before.

I liked the “never meet your heroes” message that the movie *seemed* to be working towards with Gorr. I thought *Thor: Ragnarok* already had a similar theme—the ones you look up to (i.e. Odin) may not be as good as you seem—so I was curious where else they would take it. You know what they did? They abandoned it halfway through. We had one quick scene where Thor realizes, oh shit! Gorr was right! And then he escapes with Sweet Child ‘O Mine blasting through the destruction. 

I wish Thor changed from that oh-shit-the-villain-was-right moment like he did with Loki, Hela and Thanos. Loki’s betrayal made Thor understand empathy and responsibility. Hela’s revelation of her past and Odin’s lies made Thor re-define what it means to be Asgardian, and what it means to be Asgard’s King. Thanos’s victory was an absolute breaking point that put Thor face-to-face with his pride. But Gorr wasn’t even present when Thor realized he was on to something, and from that disappointing confrontation with Zeus, Thor learned… that rocks can’t really die. And then he goes and saves the day. Your heroes always let you down, amirite?!

I was hoping the “never meet your heroes” theme would return during the climax. It would have been more poignant and impactful if Thor really did fail the people he had set out to save. With all of Gorr’s rambling, that’s where I thought the movie would go, but then the final message became some vague cliche about choosing love… over what? Revenge? Thor says one line that I felt came full circle at the end, but I missed the progression that led him to saying that line. Thor matured because the dialogue called for it, not because of anything that happened to him in the film.

At least we got our happy ending. I was aww-ing during the closing scene—I thought it fitting and sweet.

The MCU always surprises me by giving Thor another direction in which to grow. I feel like in almost every Thor movie, Thor starts out as the most immature little brat to ever walk the Nine Worlds, but he’s wisened up poignantly by the end. I thought Infinity War was peak Thor because at that point he felt like the cumulation of his development from Thor 1, 2, and 3. But in Endgame, they completely threw all of his growth out the window to dumb him down, and Thor 4 took that even further. Love and Thunder gave Thor a new question to answer about himself—without my family and my seat on the throne, who am I?—which I felt didn’t get answered, really. What always worked with Thor movies was depriving Thor of something—his title, his weapon, his friends, his family—to strip him down from god to human. But at this point, in his own words, what more can he lose?

I suppose Thor’s identity crisis is somewhat meta: with all the director switches he’s seen, he goes in a completely different direction every movie. And the MCU has no idea what to fucking do with him.

I say just let the man retire. But according to the post-credits, THOR WILL RETURN.

6.5/10.
